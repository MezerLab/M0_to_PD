% [Boxes, scaleFactor]=mrQ_ScaleBoxes_step2(Boxes,BoxesToUse,opt,errTres,BMfile)
%
% This is Step 3 of 6 (including Step 0) in the pipeline to build the WF
% (water fraction) map. In this step, the ratio between each box's PD and
% its neighbors is calculated. The scaling is further adjusted in
% mrQ_boxScaleGlobLinear, a subsequent function that is part of this step.
